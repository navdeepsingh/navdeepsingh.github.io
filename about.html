<p>I have been in web development since 2006. While 6 months industrial training in a small digital agency which was part of my curriculum for Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science, I made my mind to pursue my career in this area. And the decision was right.</p>

<p>Starting first 4 Years, I mostly did procedural coding in PHP and layout setup in HTML/CSS using Dreamweaver that time. During that course of time, I come to know about jQuery and by playing from small animations to complex ajax calls the jQuery takes the prominent place in my skill set permanently.</p>

<p>In 2011, I got the oppurtunity to work directly for a Singapore based company named iNEO, not Neo of Matrix</p>
