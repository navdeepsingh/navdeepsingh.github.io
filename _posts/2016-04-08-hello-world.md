Hello World!

These are words which every programmer print out on his/her computer whenever he/she learns new programming language. And to introduce myself with world through this channel these words are best.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
